| [Countdown Widget (Main Submission)](https://github.com/Bradley5922/Countdown-CS-Project/blob/main/Countdown%20Widget/) | This is my actual completed project. The code above is the whole XCode project. The code I'm uploading is a few versions ahead of the development section of my project. <br> It is an app where you can countdown to events and add a widget to your homescreen with the new iOS 14 widgets. <br> [[Link To App Store]](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/widget-countdown/id1532721548)<br> [[Link To Repot]](https://github.com/Bradley5922/Countdown-CS-Project/blob/main/Countdown%20Widget/report_FINAL.pdf)|
| [Destinations - Ride Share](https://github.com/Bradley5922/Countdown-CS-Project/blob/main/Destinations/)      | My first project I started. I did not complete this project becuase I lost the code due to me getting my Mac repaired and Apple wipping my computer. But I didn't have the folder in iCloud drive desktop for various reason. I am very stupid. <br> However I still have the report document I started with full analysis and desgin (maybe more indepth than my other one, so use that as evidence for that if the other project is lacking. At the end of the day I did nearly finsh this project. With the report have 60+ pages<br>[[Link To Half Completed Report]](https://github.com/Bradley5922/Countdown-CS-Project/blob/main/Destinations/report%20PDF%20version%20.pdf)|
