| [Countdown Widget (Main Submission)](https://github.com/Jami-p42/A-Level-Coding-Project/tree/main/VueJS%20Quiz) | This is my actual completed project. The code above is the whole XCode project. The code I'm uploading is a few versions ahead of the development section of my project. <br> It is an app where you can countdown to events and add a widget to your homescreen with the new iOS 14 widgets. <br> [[Link To App Store]](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/widget-countdown/id1532721548)|
| [Destinations - Ride Share](https://github.com/Jami-p42/A-Level-Coding-Project/tree/main/Weather%20Application)      | My first project I started. I did not complete this project becuase I lost the code due to me getting my Mac repaired and Apple wipping my computer. But I didn't have the folder in iCloud drive desktop for various reason. I am very stupid. <br> However I still have the report document I started with full analysis and desgin (maybe more indepth than my other one, so use that as evidence for that if the other project is lacking.<br>[[Link To Half Completed Report]](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/widget-countdown/id1532721548)|
